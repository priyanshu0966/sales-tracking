Task 5: Data Analysis on CSV Files

Objective
Analyze sales data using Python and Pandas to generate meaningful insights and visualizations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for code execution)

Dataset
A CSV file containing sales data with columns like:

3.Explore the Dataset

df.head(), df.info(), df.describe()

4.Group and Analyze

a.Total sales by region:

df.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum()

b.Total revenue by product:

df.groupby('Product')['Revenue'].sum()

5.Visualize the Insights
